# Hello Cargo — Rust Guessing Game 🎯

A simple **command-line number guessing game** written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).  
This project follows the *Guessing Game* example from *The Rust Programming Language* book and demonstrates Rust fundamentals like user input, loops, and pattern matching.

---

## 🦀 Overview

The program randomly chooses a number between **1 and 100**, and the player tries to guess it.  
After each attempt, the game reports whether the guess is **too small**, **too big**, or **correct** — looping until the correct number is guessed.
